# The Robot Nearly Killed Me

The Vergecast is back with Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Tom Warren. No iPhones were bent in the creation of this episode, nor were any bricked by rogue iOS updates.

# A Meter of Sweat

Chris Plante joins Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn on this week's Vergecast to read his unstructured, free verse poetry about the HTC Re Camera. Or maybe it's Re Poetry.

# An Incorrect Oral History of Vaping

Following an immediate but brief foray into Nilay Patel’s dark memoir-in-progress, the Vergecast progresses nicely into a week chock full of news, led by Nilay, Dieter Bohn, and David Pierce.

# Hypecheck

To some, it's a black-and-white answer. To others, it's a subtle gray. Some say hype can't be felt, only psychically perceived. It's a beacon of hope, a pillar of truth. We cannot see it, but we know it exists. It's everywhere and nowhere, all at once. We follow its call, but fear its power. We may never agree about what hype truly is, but that doesn't matter. We all know deep down inside that what really counts is that hype is in us all: teeming, stirring, ready to be checked.

Also, we have reviews of the 13-inch Macbook Pro (yeah the one without the Touch Bar), Paul’s weekly segment “Cookie Pods,” and some great ad reads in between. 01:49 - The Verge turns 5 15:58 - Google Home 27:49 - Google Assistant 40:35 - Macbook Pro 1:06:27 - Paul’s weekly segment “Cookie Pods” We want to thank the listeners, new and old, for tuning in each and giving feedback on the show, we greatly appreciate it. A quote from Nilay on this week’s episode: “We launched The Verge basically on the back of this podcast. This podcast when Paul and I were doing it with Josh as the Engadget podcast was so popular that we could fucking leave and start a new podcast, our listeners came with us, and we were able to launch This Is My Next and then The Verge so it’s wild that we’ve done it for five years.”

# Bonus: Brian Merchant, author of The One Device

We’re doing two episodes of The Vergecast this week — the usual one on Friday, and this very special edition with Brian Merchant, author of The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone. We ran a big excerpt of the book this week, and we got deep on talking about the book, where it came from, and Merchant’s feeling that we should know more about the technology products in our lives — and know more about the hundreds of people who make them, from the unsung engineers at tech companies to the extremely unsung miners who dig the raw materials out of the ground. And, of course, we talk about the quotes from Tony Fadell and Bill Bilbrey in the excerpt we just published, in which Fadell tells a story about Phil Schiller arguing the iPhone should have a hardware keyboard. Schiller has said the story isn’t true, and Fadell has tried to walk it back as well. “So I wasn't in the room at Apple 10, 15 years ago when this would have happened,” says Merchant, who has the exchange on tape. “But this is a quote verbatim as Tony Fadell who was in the room told it to me. He told me this quote in such detail and he gave such a vivid account and I had no reason to believe it was untrue.” Merchant says the controversy has “blown him away.” “It certainly wasn't intended to make Phil Schiller look dumb. It was an opposing viewpoint... I think that it's totally fine to be a dissenting voice and want to contextualize this emergent technology and even be opposed to it. Why would you not have someone in the room who is forcing people to think critically about this potentiality?” There’s a lot more on the podcast, including a deep dive into the early research projects at Apple exploring touch interfaces.

# App Store chaos, ray tracing, and new Macbook Air rumors

This week on The Vergecast, Paul, Nilay, and Dieter start off the show with the news that Netflix is testing a payment feature to bypass Apple’s App Store fees, which leads into a larger discussion of (as Nilay calls it) “App Store chaos.” Paul seems pretty excited about “ray tracing” — a term that Nvidia is using for its upcoming graphics cards — so the crew explains what that means and how far ahead Nvidia is compared to its competition. Competition is a general theme in this week’s episode. We’ve also got our two recurring segments in the show: deputy editor Liz Lopatto’s “This Week in Elon Musk” (which is now a newsletter) and Paul’s segment “Cold ears, warm heart.” And we must not forget the latest Apple rumors that have hit the news in preparation for the likely Apple event in September.

# Silicon Valley’s Rep. Ro Khanna talks tech regulation

On this week’s interview episode, Nilay is joined by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Verge policy reporter Makena Kelly to discuss Congress’ plans to regulate Big Tech in the new year. Earlier this month, Democrats were able to take back a majority in the House of Representatives, and after blockbuster events this year like Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, lawmakers are gearing up to rein in these Silicon Valley giants.

Khanna, who represents the California district that houses the Apple and Google campuses, was tasked with developing a set of principles these companies should abide by when it comes to issues like privacy, net neutrality, and anti-competitive behavior. He made the rounds, consulting with think tanks, the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, and the tech companies themselves. From those discussions, Khanna was able to put forth a framework of 10 rights US citizens should have when they’re on the internet.

Khanna’s set of principles is called the “Internet Bill of Rights,” and with Democrats recapturing the House, tech leaders like Khanna have a chance to codify ideas like these into laws.

# Being hopeful about the web with Paul Ford

This week on the interview episode of _The Vergecast_, editor of cheif of The Verge Nilay Patel sits down with CEO of Postlight Paul Ford. 

Paul Ford co-founded Postlight in 2015 and is a writer, product strategist, educator, programmer, and software consultant. 

If you read a lot of tech writing, you probably know Paul’s name. In 2015, Ford wrote an entire issue of Bloomberg’s _Business Week_ titled “_What is code?”  _which colorfully explained how programming works on the web for people who don’t do it. Recently, he wrote a piece in _Wired_ about how we should still be hopeful and excited about tech and what it can still do for us. 

Theres a lot of negative conversation about tech lately — regulating huge companies, what Facebook and Amazon are doing wrong — but from someone who builds things for the web, Paul brings an optimistic look at how tech can positively and creatively impact our lives in a fun and exciting way. 

Paul comes in to talk about his hopefulness, his piece in _Wired_, the state of building stuff for the web, and  how people think about tech today.

# TechFreedom's Berin Szóka on bad tech policy

This week on the _Vergecast _interview series, _The Verge _editor-in-chief Nilay Patel sits down with Berin Szóka, the president of TechFreedom. [TechFreedom](http://techfreedom.org/) is a tech policy think tank based in Washington, DC that “digs deep into the hard policy and legal questions raised by technological change.”

Berin and Nilay have differed on a few issues regarding tech policy, like net neutrality, but what they do agree on is the state of the tech policy conversation — [it’s bad](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20759191/white-house-trump-administration-social-media-bias-executive-order-report). Szóka says Republicans he has previously worked with are now getting important topics like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act wrong, and bad-faith politicians are misinterpreting it to try to score points and pass policy in their favor.

Hear Berin talk about what’s happening now with legislation like [Sen. Josh Hawley’s platform moderation bills](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18684219/josh-hawley-section-230-facebook-youtube-twitter-content-moderation), why it’s weird for conservatives to want to directly regulate speech on the internet, and how this might play out in the future. Below is a lightly edited excerpt of the conversation.

# Will the Sprint and T-Mobile merger create competition?

This week for our interview series on _The Vergecast_, host and _Verge_ editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Technology Law and Policy. We’ve had Gigi [on the show before](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687903/net-neutrality-was-repealed-a-year-ago-whats-happened-since) to talk about the ramifications following the repeal of net neutrality.

This time, we brought her back to talk about some recent developments in the tech policy world, including lawmakers in states like California introducing net neutrality bills.

We also talk to Gigi about the Sprint and T-Mobile merger and the issues surrounding how that merger will seemingly go through unless it’s stopped by a lawsuit from several states. Can Dish become a fourth mobile carrier?

# What happened in the comments section of the FCC's net neutrality hearing?

This week on _[The Vergecast_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725), _Verge_ editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with Jeremy Singer-Vine, the data editor for the _BuzzFeed News_ investigative unit, about [his story that was published recently](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jsvine/net-neutrality-fcc-fake-comments-impersonation) regarding the fake comments on the Federal Communications Commission’s online net neutrality debate.

If you haven’t read [the piece](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jsvine/net-neutrality-fcc-fake-comments-impersonation), you should. The investigation details where all of the fake comments in the FCC’s net neutrality process came from, including dead people leaving comments and shady political operatives involved in the scam.

It’s not really a story about net neutrality; rather, it’s about how systems designed for public participation in the government are so easily scammed, and what the challenges are for preventing such scams from happening.

Nilay and Jeremy discuss why it happened, how it happened, and what happens next if we want to use the internet to encourage open access participation in government without corruption.

# How America gave up on free markets with Thomas Philippon

On this week’s Vergecast interview, _Verge_ editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to finance professor and an economist at the NYU stern school of business Thomas Philippon. Thomas just wrote a book called _The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets _all about competition and consolidation in different markets.

When Thomas moved to the United States from France in the 90s, he noticed everything from laptops to internet access was cheaper in America, but over time has gotten more and more expensive. In the interview Nilay and Thomas discuss why that is — unsurprisingly the answer is consolidation in a lot of our markets.

Thomas makes a point that in some places, concentrations are actually good and creates value for the consumers, but in some markets like healthcare, technology, and airtravel, that consolidation has resulted in way higher prices for Americans. Since the prices go up slowly, we don’t actually notice.

If you have been listening to _The Vergecast _and been paying attention to our big conversations about whether or not we should be breaking up big tech companies, whether we should regulate them, or whether tech companies with network effects like Google and Facebook are different than companies like AT&T and GE, this conversation is up your alley. Below is lightly edited except of the conversation.

# Neil Young says the Macbook Pro has “Fisher-Price” audio quality

Musician Neil Young and tech executive Phil Baker have been trying to push the tech industry to make it easier for consumers to listen to high-quality audio for almost a decade now. The duo’s hi-res music player [Pono](https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7505897/pono-player-neil-young-ces-2015) aimed to fix problems they said plagued MP3 players like the iPod and music software like iTunes — like compressed, lossy, and low-fidelity audio files that were not similar enough to their original recordings.

But five years after the Pono was released, Young believes the tech industry has still not advanced enough for consumers to easily listen to high resolution audio. The two men’s new book, _To Feel the Music: A Songwriter’s Mission To Save High Quality Audio_, details the hurdles they had to overcome to create the Pono, as well as what the tech industry should do in order to get consumers to realize what their missing with streaming and “CD-quality” music.

In an interview with _[The Vergecas_](http://theverge.com/the-vergecast)_t_, Young tells Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel that even though Grammy-winning artists are able to make music almost anywhere they go on their laptop or mobile devices, they’re still sacrificing on audio fidelity.

# How 5G and edge computing fit into the future of Intel’s traditionally chip-focused lineup

Intel is one of the biggest names in the tech world, with chips that quite literally are the brains behind most of the computers and servers that we use every day. But the world of computers is expanding and Intel is changing, too, with a focus on both edge computing that puts processing resources in the cloud and the power that’s available directly on the physical device. 

And at the head of that is [Dr. Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala](https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/dr-murthy-renduchintala/), the chief engineering officer and group president of the Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group at Intel. Renduchintala joined Intel in 2016, having previously headed up competitor Qualcomm’s chip business. 

Renduchintala is the person in charge of almost all of Intel’s hardware, from design to engineering to manufacturing. He joined _Verge_ editor-in-chief Nilay Patel and news editor Chaim Gartenberg for an interview episode of _[The Vergecast_](http://theverge.com/the-vergecast) this week to discuss the present and future of Intel, including the company’s place in the development of 5G, the changing landscape of personal- and cloud-based computing, and what the next-generation of processors could look like.

# New Jersey’s former attorney general on Ring cameras and facial recognition

In this week’s _Vergecast_, former New Jersey attorney general Anne Milgram stopped by the studio to talk with _Verge_ editor in chief Nilay Patel and me, senior reporter Colin Lecher.

As Nilay notes, Milgram, who also co-hosts the podcast Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara, is “the first cop we’ve ever had on the show,” and gave some thoughtful responses to questions about surveillance, predictive policing, and more.

“We all, I think, have the right reaction, which is we don’t want to use data that’s biased or we don’t want to have problems,” Milgram says. “And yet in our personal lives, we give access to a huge amount of information and a lot of it is not public.”

The rise of home security systems like Amazon’s Ring camera have raised serious questions about privacy, and Milgram weighed in on the issue. Below is an excerpt for that conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity.

# Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman welcomes you to Team Antitrust

Antitrust criticism of big tech companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon have been louder than ever — from the consumers to the tech companies who compete with them. Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman [has been vocal for years](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html) about the problem with Google’s dominant market share in maps, local search, and reviews.

“I’ve been working on it for over a decade and it’s great to see that more people have jumped on board.” Stoppelman says. “When we started out criticizing Google and highlighting some of their abuses, we got — especially from Silicon Valley — so many eye rolls.”

_The Verge_’s Nilay Patel and Casey Newton recently caught up with Stoppelman to discuss the evolving view of the media and the public on the tech monopolies, as well as how Yelp is handling their competition and what possible changes can be made with regulation from the government.

# Decoder: The future of remote learning with Sal Khan of Khan Academy

For the next few Tuesday's, we'll be sharing Nilay Patel's new podcast _Decoder,_ an interview show that puts a spotlight on how innovators and policymakers at the frontiers of business and technology are navigating an ever-changing landscape.

On this week’s episode of Decoder, Nilay Patel talks with Sal Khan, the co-founder and CEO of Khan Academy, a nonprofit online learning platform for students in kindergarten through high school. Khan Academy is an organization that exists _because_ of technology. What started with Sal tutoring his niece in math over video using off the shelf cameras and software, has grown into an organization with nearly 20 million users per month, available in 46 languages and used in more than 190 countries. And online learning has gotten even more vital with the pandemic.

In this conversation, Nilay and Sal discuss the future of learning, what online education is good at and where it struggles, how Khan Academy is growing, and how Sal’s thinking about handling trickier subjects like history and social studies.

# Decoder: Microsoft's Phil Spencer on launching the new Xbox

On this week’s episode of Decoder Nilay Patel talks to Phil Spencer, the guy in charge of Xbox at Microsoft. They discuss not only the next-generation Xbox and PS5 just arriving in stores now, but how gaming itself has become part of mainstream culture, a trend that has definitely accelerated during the pandemic. We’ve also reached an inflection point for game streaming: Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all have services that allow consumers to play games on any device by streaming them over the internet, kind of like Netflix for games. Is that the future?
