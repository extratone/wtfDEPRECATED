"DalaiLama ...let's try better braking discipline and torque converter alternatives first, k? I'm afraid I'm a more potent activist here!" DalaiLama gotta state that system of ethics beforehand! DalaiLama I am genuinely impressed by your ability to sell intolerance as enlightenment to so many people. Hitler could've learned a lot. "DalaiLama remember that we vary, Lammy! I hope one day you're able to see the beauty in the diversity of human's happy waking sentiments." DalaiLama I think you may have mixed up your fruits. ?? "DalaiLama I'd advise you stop advising folks to be so concerned with others, then. Once comfortable with yourself, violence becomes petty." "DalaiLama actually, ""compassion"" is present in most species. We're definitely the only one to go to the moon, though." "DalaiLama MUCH better worded. Now a theory instead of a demand! Unfortunately, human beings aren't naturally burdened." "DalaiLama YEEEES! You got it buddy! That is true insight, through and through! Proud of u! :)" DalaiLama sounds like rough times. I'm sorry you've been so riddled with contradiction... I'm here if you'd like to talk about it. "DalaiLama ALMOST!!!!!! Just ONE thing... You forgot that humans vary! That's a big one! Gotta lose ""happiness"" or suppoits universality!" "DalaiLama you motivated me to finally get off the couch and disarm my last one! Thanks, Lammy! ??" DalaiLama ok...gonna have to be a bit more specific dude...lol "DalaiLama you're confusing cause and effect, I'm afraid." "DalaiLama one of my second graders beat ya to that one, Grandpa! ????" DalaiLama conservation of matter! Doh! ?? DalaiLama somebody forgot primary physics! ?? The quickest way between two points is a straight line haha "DalaiLama YES! So glad you're ready to join us! Any idea what you'd like to do, professionally? I'd recommend steering clear of writing. ??" "DalaiLama ouch!... Gotta clarify your assumptions before you state a thesis like that. We don't know which ""good"" you're referring to!" "DalaiLama I'm available for the next few weeks if you'd like some pointers! (For a small fee, of course.)" "DalaiLama uh oh! Somebody forgot to suppotheir argument! Definite no no, especially when dictating (to every human) their life purpose." DalaiLama you have an extraordinary talent for conjuring THE most obvious assumptions in all cognitively-functioning beings. "DalaiLama ah. I suppose you should probably put the phone down, then." "DalaiLama doting on 12 billion individuals constantly would certainly nullify an individual's use in anything, including progression." LOW_LIMIT: LOW_LIMIT tpnug this is a poem. "Playahaters wanna know who you are when you're comin down like a superstar " Whew... The Dallas Llama is gonna have to step up his effoif he's gonna graduate this year. DalaiLama define those terms! State those assumptions! "DalaiLama or, just eliminate the problems by teaching them to value themselves." DalaiLama ...these and trust can ONLY be grown from the understanding you have been so ignorantly obstructing. "DalaiLama friends are made on the basis of respect, reverence, and preference" "DalaiLama absolutely! But leave it to us, please." "DalaiLama we HAVE been using it... We have built the most beautiful things in sight. You are always welcome to join us." "DalaiLama learn to find satisfaction in yourself, and harming others won't even occur to you. You don't need others to feel joy!" "DalaiLama I think it's time to see a doctor if you've been forgetting what species you are, Holiness." "DalaiLama ""tolerance"" and ""common goal"" in the same sentence makes for an awfully pretty oxymoron... Perhaps it's time to retire." "DalaiLama just look inwards for a change; know the contradiction you've created, and your fear will lose all power over you." "DalaiLama honesty with ourselves and our existence IS self-confidence, which nurtures our ability to blossom kindness and real compassion." DalaiLama I had no idea you'd tried it! Do tell! DalaiLama you only see yourself as immaterial because you so persistently subveyour identity. Open your eyes to the substance within you "DalaiLama your mind will calm, Holiness, when you stop this feverish war against your beautifully physical nature." DalaiLama what a relief! I'm glad you're responsible for me! Could I borrow some cash or is your only wealth in platitudinous babble? "DalaiLama a greater and significantly more efficient solution would be to consult the expert: ""How can I be more happy and more at peace?""" "DalaiLama if you cannot first show them when and why to show affection, it will never mean anything." "DalaiLama take a moment to first build yourself, and you will feel anger totally and completely lose its power over you." guanyu2510: Hugh as fuck. Gonna quit drinking.

"Parental love means little to nothing to me. The only love is loving someone for who they are, not simply because they exist." Pessimism is honesty.

Please don't read anything I have to say. I have no desire to depress anyone. "I have no desire to ""make my mark"" on the world.

The grouping of people into the church NOT the ideas of religion itself are to blame for the atrocities associated with religion. The religion of Christianity is noble. The institution of the Christian Church is a group psychology brainwashing fuckfest. That fact contradicts all those attributes. "NoamChomski: The Nazis used psychological warfare to subdue populations, the mass media today uses PsyOps to subdue the people in an ..." "I thought Ron Paul was objective, intelligent, honest, and sensible. Then I found out he's against abortion because of his religion." "Want to be ""happy?"" Get a dog. Get a religion." It's also touching to see how much happiness religion can bring to people. "I used to think that a noble purpose in life would be to aspire to be better than I am, accepting that it will never happen." "Though I have these ideas, I still spend a lot of time around people of religion. And it is so scary to see how misled they are." Neither you nor I have any scope of how the universe works. Human beings will never understand. We might as well be happy. That's why I'd ask you to leave people of religion alone. Let them be happy. Don't impose what you think is fact on them. I have all the aspirations of a Christian without the hope. It's a horrible feeling. "I suppose that would be an example of ""too much of a good thing.""" "At least Christians hold sex as something sacred, as opposed to society." """Sexual energy must be channeled constructively."" - RobeLewis." Then they'll give a great advice about how revenge isn't worth it. Then I'll tell them to shut the fuck up. "The next time an older person talks condescendingly to me, I'm going to turn the conversation to revenge." The only logical reason I see to condescend on those who are younger than you is that you've suffered longer. So what is that? Revenge? Though studies have shown that experience matters little in situations of stress. I have no credibility. Because I have little experience. It wouldn't be such a bad thing to preach your views if people didn't just eat it up. "Please don't ever let me ever tell someone that I love them when I only love the idea of them, Twitter."
